# Count the number of Faces using Python â€“ OpenCV


### Required libraries:

[OpenCV](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/)  library in Python is a computer vision library, mostly used for image processing, video processing, and analysis, facial recognition and detection, etc.

[Dlib](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-10-57348ba1117f) library in Python contains the pre-trained facial landmark detector, that is used to detect the (x, y) coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.

[Numpy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-numpy/)  is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays.
